            <p>
                I have just one story to tell, my journey to an <span style="color:rgb(0, 255, 191)"><i class="fas fa-university"></i></span> IIT. 
                I was in 7th standard When my mom put me in a coaching institute mainly because I used to study just one hour and still 
                manage to ace school <span style="color:rgb(255, 217, 0)"><i class="fas fa-atom"></i></span> examinations, so my mom wanted me to keep myself busy so, she put me in RESONANCE, to which I agreed with excitement because they teach you extra stuff that isn't in textbooks and
                I love knowing things. but gosh, it was an amazing experience <span style="color:rgb(255, 230, 0)"><i class="fas fa-atom"></i></span> but from 1 hour-a-day , I went to like 3 hours of self-study keeping school hours aside. My routine became like 8am to 1 pm school, 1pm-2:30pm lunch, 3pm to 8pm coaching,8pm-10pm dinner and enjoyment and 10pm to 12 am homework from coaching and schools.oh yeah it was too much, and that's
                the most I have ever been in pressure.
            </p>
            <p> 
                But time passed, it made me a better, more knowledgable, and experienced person. Fast forward to 4 years later, in 11th standard, my only goal became to ace JEE. 
                At the start, I wasn't much serious about it, so sometimes I skipped homework <span style="color:rgb(35, 156, 255)"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i></span> 
                which is the "worst" thing you can do, honestly. But my one <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 242)"><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i></span> 
                friend, been a true <span style="color:rgb(229, 255, 0)"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></span>inspiration<span style="color:rgb(208, 255, 0)"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></span>. He does homework, so does me, else I would feel this "weird" guilt, and it happens in reverse too; I do my H.W. so does he. Coachings would have been really hard if you don't have a friend <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 242)"><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i></span>. Fortunately, I had <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 242)"><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i></span>friends. You see, you can't be motivated <span style="color:rgb(217, 255, 0)"><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i></span> to an exam forever; that's when friends come into play when you hit your low, your friend encourages <span style="color:rgb(217, 255, 0)"><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i></span> you, and when they hit their low, you help them. So, for us, it's not like "I cracked JEE!";
                it's more like "We cracked JEE!". My friends are now on separate ways, but we still are connected and grateful that we became <br>
